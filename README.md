Kodi (XBMC) Telekom Basketball Addon
====================================

**Note: This Addon has been replaced by [kodi-telekomsport](https://github.com/hubsif/kodi-telekomsport)!**

About
-----

This addon let's you watch the German Basketball (Beko BBL) streams from [Telekom Basketball] [1].
It's a quick hack I wrote for a friend, so there might be issues, as it's not
well tested.

Prerequisites
-------------

In order to use this plugin you need to register at [Telekom Basketball]
[1], which is for free for Deutsche Telekom customers with either a mobile
flatrate or an internet flatrate contract.

Usage
-----

Download the addon zipfile from the [releases page] [2] or the code via git
and put it into your addons folder. In addon settings enter your login data
and hopefully enjoy watching the streams.
